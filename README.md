# Flower ðŸŒ¸

A visual and perceptual experience inspired by the **Flower of Life**, a geometric design rich in history and symbolism.

## Overview

This project invites users to explore the mesmerizing Flower of Life pattern through a focus-shifting technique, providing a meditative and immersive experience.

## Inspiration

The **Flower of Life** is a symbol found in art, architecture, and philosophy across various cultures. It represents creation, interconnectedness, and the infinite nature of the universe.

## How to Use

1. **Train Your Eyes**
   - Hold your thumb up at armâ€™s length and focus on it.
   - Quickly move your thumb away from your face, while trying to keep your gaze fixed on the spot where it was.
   - This exercise helps improve the flexibility of your focus and strengthens your ability to shift your attention smoothly.
   - Practice moving your thumb in different directions and distances, allowing your eyes to adjust and refocus each time.
   - Over time, this will help you develop better control over your eye movements and improve your ability to focus on distant objects.

2. **Drawing Circle Technique**
   - If the moon is not visible, draw a circle on a blank white paper.
   - Hold the paper at a comfortable distance and adjust your focus.
   - Move the paper closer or farther and attempt to focus on the circle.
   - Over time, try to perceive multiple, separate circles as your eyes adjust to different focal points.

3. **Stereograms**
   - Stereograms are a great practice to help develop your ability to shift focus.
   - These images contain hidden 3D patterns that can only be seen by adjusting the focus in a particular way.
   - Regular practice with stereograms can improve your focus control and strengthen your eye coordination.

4. **Real Experience**
   - Look at the moon.
   - Change the focus of your eyes until you see overlapping patterns or "multiple moons."

5. **Explore the Geometry**
   - Discover how the Flower of Life pattern creates a sense of unity and harmony.
