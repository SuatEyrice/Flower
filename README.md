## How to Use

1. **Train Your Eyes**
   - Hold your thumb up at armâ€™s length and focus on it.
   - Quickly move your thumb away from your face, while trying to keep your gaze fixed on the spot where it was.
   - This exercise enhances the flexibility of your focus and strengthens your ability to shift attention smoothly.
   - Practice moving your thumb in different directions and distances, allowing your eyes to adjust and refocus each time.
   - Over time, this will help you develop better control over your eye movements and improve your ability to focus on distant objects.

2. **Focus Observation**
   - Look at the moon.
   - Adjust the focus of your eyes until you perceive overlapping patterns or "multiple moons," unveiling deeper visual insights.

3. **Drawing Circle Technique**
   - If the moon is not visible, draw a circle on a blank white paper.
   - Hold the paper at a comfortable distance and adjust your focus.
   - Move the paper closer or farther and attempt to focus on the circle.
   - Over time, try to perceive multiple, separate circles as your eyes adjust to different focal points, revealing hidden patterns.

4. **Stereograms for Focus Shifting practice**
   - Stereograms are excellent tools to develop your ability to shift focus.
   - These images contain hidden 3D patterns that become visible by adjusting your focus in a specific way.
   - Regular practice with stereograms can improve your focus control and strengthen eye coordination, aiding in perceiving the deeper meanings of the Flower of Life.

5. **Explore the Geometry**
   - Open the included design files (`Flower.png`).
   - Study how the Flower of Life pattern embodies unity and harmony, and reflect on its deeper meanings.
